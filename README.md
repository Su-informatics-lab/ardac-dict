# ARDaC Data Dictionary
This repository contains the data model for the [Alcohol Research Data Commons (ARDaC)](https://ardac.org/), which is deployed using the [Gen3](https://gen3.org) data commons platform.

For general information about dictionaries in Gen3, see the [Gen3 Data Dictionaries](https://gen3.org/resources/user/dictionary/) documentation.

Deployable versions of the ARDaC data dictionary are available at https://dictionary.ardac.org, e.g.: https://dictionary.ardac.org/1.0.0/schema.json.

To recreate a version of the dictionary, check out the appropriate tag and use the Gen3 [dictionaryutils](https://github.com/uc-cdis/dictionaryutils) to create a JSON file that can be deployed in Gen3.

For step-by-step instructions on how to make changes to the dictionary, please see the `development` guide in the `DOCS` folder.
